![Real-time Ray Marched Snow Man](snow_man.jpg)

Design
================================
I constructed the snow man in my custom scene by breaking it down into three parts, the head of the snow man, the body of the snow man, and his hat.  The head is constructed from three spheres: one for the actual head and two for the eyes.  The body is constructed through 5 spheres: one for the bottom of the snow man, one for the torso, and three for the buttons.  The hat is constructed from a torus and a cylinder.  Each is placed in it's proper place with estimate distance functions defined.  A noise function is used in the estimate distance functions for head and body to add a noise texture to the snow man to make him more interesting.

Results
================================
The following are results from our program and custom scene.

Questions
================================
1. I really liked the shader "Interactive thinks" by Sebastien Durand, username iapafoto, found [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xt3SR4).  It appealed to me due to the ability to change various settings in the scene to make it look very different and how concise the code for it is.  This shader uses a sine wave in a fractal to generate images and allows sliders to change different values in the program to produce different fractals.  It also uses a spiral noise function which adda and rotates sin waves while increasing the frequency.  It also has a renderSuperstructure method that seems to be dealing with shading and lighting of the fractal.

2. [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) were addition resources I used apart from the Graphics Codex on this project.

3. Here are some differences between C/C++ and GLSL.
    - No recursion
    - No pointers
    - Specifying parameters as inout if you want to pass-by-reference
    - No debug printf to write to output for debugging
    - Everything in glsl involves vectors with its vec3 struture
    - Minimizing the amount of branching

Self-Review
================================
I think I deserve a B for this project due to the following reasons.

Code Design
--------------------------------
I thought my code design was good for the most part, but I was unable to figure out how to avoid branching as much I would have liked.

Expected Code Correctness
--------------------------------
I think my code is correct and follows the guidelines in the specification.

Scene Visual Quality
--------------------------------
My custom scene is pretty boring; I wish I could have had more time to play with implicit surfaces and make it better.

Expected Report Correctness
--------------------------------
I think my report is correct and an accurate representation of my project as a whole.

Skills
================================
Skills and knowledge gained through this lab.

Engineering
--------------------------------
- Programing in GLSL
- Better applying software engineering skills learned earlier in the course
- Efficiently writing solo code
- Reading and understanding Shadertoy code

Algorithmic
--------------------------------
- Ray Marching Algorithm
- Better understanding of Ray Tracing Algorithm

Mathematical
--------------------------------
- Many different distance estimators
- Applying transformations to different shapes
